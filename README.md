# Bookshelf

## Keep track of your favourite books and new books you want to read.

Bookshelf is for **book lovers, book clubs, or for anyone who has an interest in reading.**
Users will be able to keep track books they've read along with a rating and a review on the book. 
They will also be able to add books that they are interested in reading in the future 
along with a brief description about the book. As an avid reader myself, having a uniqiue application
to keep track of my books and also be able to add personal descriptions for them allows me to stay connected to my
personal hobbies and interests.
